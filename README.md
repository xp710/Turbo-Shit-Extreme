Turbo Shit Extreme
-------------------

Changes:
Added a few upgrades, removed a few as well.

Changed how the upgrades are given. Instead of at the end of each level, it's at the end of the first
3 waves of a level. If the player already has 6 powerups when a powerup would be given, they instead lose
3 powerups. This is to make the game constantly change and to not just let the player get overpowered.

Added music and sound. Both are pretty buggy.

Changed the way the code accesses files so that only the .jar file needs to be distributed.

Changed the enemy sprites to look like poop.
